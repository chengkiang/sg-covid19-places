The Ministry of Health (MOH) publishes a daily list of places visited by COVID-19 cases while they were infectious. Unforunately, not only is it buried deep in the annals of the MOH website, it's in a PDF, not exactly a friendly format for use on the web. Recently, I came across [this map](https://ppvbc.github.io) done by a fellow developer named [Chong](https://github.com/chpeck), and he has made the data available on GitHub. I believe he extracted them from the MOH data. Kudos for the effort!

Using the same data, I presented it as a table instead, which I find is easier to read.
